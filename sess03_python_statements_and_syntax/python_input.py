# Notes on Python division

# 1. Standard Division(/) : The / operator performs floating-point

# division. This means it will always return a float, even if the

# division results in a whole number.

quotient1 = 10 / 3

print(quotient1)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335

quotient2 = 10 / 2

print(quotient2)  # Output: 5.0

# 2. Floor Division(//) Also called integer division : The // operator

# performs floor division. This means it divides and then rounds down to

# the nearest whole number (integer).

quotient3 = 10 // 3

print(quotient3)  # Output: 3

quotient4 = 10 // 2

print(quotient4)  # Output: 5

quotient5 = 10.0 // 3

print(quotient5)  # Output: 3.0 (the result is still a float, but floored)
